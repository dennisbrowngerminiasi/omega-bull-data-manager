"""Reference client for the NDJSON quote server.

This module demonstrates the full set of request/response operations
supported by the NDJSON TCP service:

``list_tickers``
    Discover the tickers currently backed by shared memory.

``get_quote``
    Fetch a point-in-time quote from the in-memory cache.  The server
    replies with pricing fields such as ``price`` and ``volume`` along
    with metadata like ``currency`` and ``stale``.

``get_snapshot_epoch``
    Inspect the global snapshot seqlock state to understand when the
    shared memory was last updated.

``get_shm_name``
    Discover the name of the shared-memory segment used for historical
    bars.  Clients need this value to attach directly for history reads.  The
    server responds with an error if no shared-memory region is configured.

``StockDataReader.get_stock``
    (client side) Read historical bars directly from the shared memory
    region using a seqlock style loop that verifies the perâ€‘ticker epoch
    before and after loading the JSON payload.  The example below shows
    how a client would instantiate the reader once the shared-memory name
    is discovered.

Every request sent to the server **must** include three fields:

``v``
    Protocol version (always ``1``).

``id``
    Client supplied correlation identifier used to match requests with
    responses.

``type``
    Operation such as ``list_tickers`` or ``get_quote``.  Missing any of
    the above fields will yield a ``BAD_REQUEST`` error with the list of
    missing names.

When executed as a script this module will:

1. Print the shared-memory segment name.
2. Print the list of available tickers.
3. Retrieve and print the latest quote for the first ticker.
4. Show the snapshot epoch metadata.
5. Attempt to read historical bars for the first ticker using
   :class:`StockDataReader` and a lower-level helper that explicitly
   demonstrates the seqlock epoch dance.
